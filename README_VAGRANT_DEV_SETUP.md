# Vagrant Development Setup

## Local Setup
Configuring Vagrant locally is more difficult to initially setup, but is much easier to access the webserver since it doesn't require the VPN + remote desktop connection.

## Remote PDX Setup
Launching the remote server, is much easier, but is a hassle to connect to the web service because it requires a VPN connection to PDX and remote desktop connection to the Windows Server.
